# OcGenerator

OcGenerator is a service for the conversion of music files to ocarina pictorial tablature. Created as part of my dissertation/final year project at [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/|). Currenlt
it supports .wav, .ogg and .mp3 formats, with more being added in the future.

### Library Usages
* Interface written in HTML5/CSS3, powered by [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask).
* Uses the excellent [Aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio) library for pitch detection and extraction.
* And the equally-excellent [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for image segmentation and extraction

### Most recent additions:
